/// This class is meant to handle the generation of the folder structure that the BOM's will be placed into
/// The obhective is to make a consistant folder structure that is then recognized by the program so that the 
/// user doesnt have to create it.
/// The user will select a root directory where the BOM folder should reside. 
/// The folder structure will then be generated if the BOM folder is not found.
